## Raw data
There raw data comes from the smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals, 
which have been processed using various signal processing techniques to measurement vector consisting of 561 features.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were captured. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

## Tidy data set
The tidy dataset results from the following transformations performed on the raw data
It results a dataset of 561 variables and 10299 observations.

### Appropriately labels the data set
The test and training datasets were labelled with the Features vector file used to name the columns of those two datasets.

### Merge the datasets
The training and test datasets were merge into one dataset

### Extracting relevant data
Transformations were done on the dataset to keep only the mean and standard deviation measurements.
The following expression was used ("[Mm]ean\\(\\)|[Ss]td\\(\\)") to extract the relevant columns from the dataset.
It results a matrix of 66 columns and 10299 rows.

### Use descriptive activity names
The dataset was merged with the subject and activities datasets in order to add those information in the dataset.
It results a dataset of 69 colums and 10299 rows

### Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
A second dataset with the average of each variable per activities and per subject was made using the aggregate function

### Editing files
A text file and a csv file were edited once the rax data cleaned.
